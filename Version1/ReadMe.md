For the sake of this assignment, we will ignore the human portion of testing, including walkthroughs and desk checking and jump right into
developing test cases for automated testing. As the program does not have multiple inputs and different parts of the code, 
or differing possibility, we will not begin the testing process with test cases from cause-effect graphing and immediately jump into black
box techniques.

Test2.java is the first JUnit test case that is run, the test is a value just outside the bonds of the input parameter, an integer. The
values 2147483648 and -2147483649 should and clearly do fail. Thus error handeling should be prevalent in the next version.
